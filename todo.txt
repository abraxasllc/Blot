Fix [Anders](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/1661bcc946b4960a) image path bug. A file titled "_på besøg hos gomorgen danmark.jpg" cannot be embedded in a blog post. Write test which ensures this doesn't happen again. This should also fix bug with case-sensitive paths to thumbnails + Dropbox client and tell Jan-Erik on Twitter DMs. Make resolve work more impressively, attempt to resolve a path in a case insensitive manner. Or is this a good idea? Maybe we should only resolve paths which match stored metadata? Or should we make a best-effort? As long as we are resolving case-only it should be fine... Tell [Michael](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/1665ddc4057851cf) it now works. This should also fix bug with accents in image paths for [Wesley](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/15f65ae5c00af8a1). Incorporate retries into the thumbnail fetcher...

Perhaps just cluster the main process? How will I verify that there is not statefullness somewhere in the server? I also want the main 'server' running on different threads to the CPU intensive stuff like image processing. Will this fix the bug with additional child processes if main process runs out of memory? Something wasn't being killed during the Nash WAV bug of August, 2018. There were duplicate node rebuild processes running.

Look into mirroring site across multiple domains and follow up with Thomas
https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/1625012def221a8f

Move to cool user subdomains
 - Pretty to proper blog IDs instead of integers

Public site
- Log 404s on the public site to identify neccessary redirects
- Personalize the documentation for logged in users
- Add a resource page to the documentation with guides like this:
  - https://twitter.com/chad_g_moore/status/975104556001583104?s=20
- Inline all CSS for performance
- Render the formatting guide navigation on the server

Developer documentation
  - Make reference page searchable
  - Add types and examples to items on reference page
  - Work how to explain the archives property

Investigate static site search offerings
- It would be nice to have one whose index you could build on 
  the server, and deliver statically, perhaps even chunked if it was huge
- Would be nice to be able to patch updates to this index quickly without
  rebuilding the whole thing

Dashboard
- Dumb quotes are still smartified, even without typeset enabled.
- Tolerate missing 'www' in personal domain field on dashboard for users with a custom domain when checking validity
- Can we trim the homepage to get to this?
                          
  - Title                 ________________  
  - Domain                | Your folder  |
  - Theme                 |              |
  - Photo                 |              |
  - URLs                  |______________|
  - Dates

  Menu, Dates, Disqus, Analytics etc. would be customized per theme
  Services page would be phased out, perhaps introducing metadata flags, e.g.
     Typeset: no
     Katex: no
  Or global flags in something like config.json. Would be rare though.
  Client would be a link at the bottom corner of the folder. Synced by Dropbox (edit)

- Generate SSL cert for www subdomain of apex domain pointed to Blot, and redirect it to apex domain. Tell [Paul](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/164423db2ef130b0)
- Implement a flags page for toggling all the settings (including hidden ones) for a given blog
- Route requests to new dashboard if toggle is on to allow thorough testing
- When a user pastes the whole tracking script into the preferences page on the dashboard,
strip out everything except the ID which we need... perhaps create a page explaining what
is happening before doing this.
- Handle noscript on dashboard / signup gracefully (remove all dashboard js?)
- Allow users who are restarting an account with multiple blogs to disable some before restarting.
- Take a look at Notion and Cargo for some neat ideas
- Disabling a blog should free up the domain and handle associated
- Removing a domain from a blog does NOT delete the domain:example.com key from redis. meaning if a user sets a domain once, it's effectively theirs forever. This is a bug!

Allow Blot to fallback to client.read if the file does not exist on the blot server. Say the harddrive is wiped, we still would like to serve blog files

Sync
- Re-implement folder verification feature and make use of the local content hash computation script to verify we have the correct version of a given file
- Make the sync / rebuild proceses run with unpriviledged user permissions to ensure shit isnt fucked with user input...
– Re-instate feature to check if a rogue sync took down the server and run sync on a seperate process
- Add method to pause syncing and prevent future syncs
then use this method with the create/remove blog migration too.
- Ensure sync script is run by less priveledged user (just access to /tmp ? /blogs/{{ID}})?

NGINX
- Improve error pages
- Recompile nginx with neccessary dependencies for auto-ssl instead of openresty
- Install nginx fail2ban & http2

Support linking to another blog post by its *file path*
- This would help with the importer to fix broken links

Generative tree
- Add a generative tree illustration to account page that is 'seeded' when you sign up and grows as you keep your account open. Slowly, day by day. Would still be growing in 1000 years should your account stay open that long.
- Learn about old trees
- Learn how to make a generative illustration and render it quickly on the server
- I like this idea because it's sort of anti-Farmville (i.e. click-to-grow, engage-to-grow). The tree just grows. No badgering to post more to keep the tree alive, all you have to do is keep your account. When you delete your account you just see the tree, and a thank you. Obviously don't do anything tacky like cut the tree down or anything. That would be horrible.

Removing Date metadata from a post should reset its date to the file's creation date
- Currently nothing changes.

Add support for 'time' metadata property
- Useful for posts with path-based-dates.
- e.g. 'Time: 4:15pm'
- Would append to any other date associated with the post.

- Generate thumbnails for GIFs / SVG thum
- Prioritize faces
- Aim to generate distinct thumbnails across the blog
- Try to crop out ruined borders. E.g. when making a square crop of a rectangular image with a border, crop into the image as well to remove the border-on-three-sides effect
- Extract color palette too for the image
- Run quickly first time, then run in the background to pick the best thumbnail
- Offer imgix style API for embedding thumbnails

IDEAS
=====

It could be nice to link to [@path/to/file.txt] and resolve the URL automatically?
  - would need a dependency tree, if change were made to file.txt, the linker would
    need to be updated too.
  - would leave a trail, like regular permalinks, so file.txt could be moved without
    breaking anything.

Add 'opener=false' to target="_blank" links?

Consider offering a broken link checker service?

Add neat interface to customize blog level variables?

add support for dynamic partials to make collections possible
e.g. {{> /{tag}.html}} ?

Move from preview files -> webloc / .url files ?
